The **Hercules Plugin Manager**, often referred to as the [[HPM]], is yet another [[Hercules Original]].

# Building a plugin

### What does building a plugin mean?

To build a plugin is the same as to [compile](https://github.com/HerculesWS/Hercules/wiki/Compiling) a plugin. This means that you want to use an existing plugin (that you may have downloaded from [the Plugin Releases forum](https://herc.ws/board/forum/142-plugin-releases/)) in a server.

### Where do I start?

The C code for the plugin normally won't have discrepancies. In order to compile the plugin, certain criteria must be met depending on your Operating System.

There are two (2) guides below: One for Windows and the other for everything else which should work on any *nix distro, as well as on OSX.

### I use a Windows Machine, what guide should I follow?
[Building HPM Plugin for MSVC](https://github.com/HerculesWS/Hercules/wiki/Building-HPM-Plugin-for-MSVC)

### I use a *nix based system (Linux or OSX), what guide should I follow?
[Building HPM Plugin for gcc](https://github.com/HerculesWS/Hercules/wiki/Building-HPM-Plugin-for-gcc)

# Creating a plugin

### What does creating a plugin mean?

Creating a plugin means to develop/design your custom source code edits that introduces new systems into RO. For example, the people who release plugins in the [Plugin Releases](https://herc.ws/board/forum/142-plugin-releases/) forum created plugins. People who use the plugins that they made should follow the **building a plugin** guide shown above.

**This is usually what more advanced users do, so if you're not sure if you're creating a plugin or not, you most likely aren't creating a plugin.**

After following the [building a plugin](#Building_a_plugin "wikilink")
guide, all thats left is for your plugin's code to be made, the
following will guide you through the basics of how a
[HPM](HPM "wikilink") plugin works.

## HPM Events

Events are functions in a plugin that are triggered by the **Hercules
Plugin Mananger** when they meet certain criteria.  
- `void server_preinit(void)`
  - Triggered when the server starts loading plugins, useful to parse battle_config
- `void plugin_init(void)`
  - Triggered when the server starts
- `void plugin_final(void)`
  - Triggered when the server starts to shut itself down
- `void server_ready(void)`
  - Triggered after the server is done starting, and is online.
- `void server_post_final(void)`
  - Triggered after the server's main shutdown procedures are complete, core functionality such as memory manager, timer, and sockets are still available at this point.

With the [HPM](HPM "wikilink") you only need to code the events your plugin will use.

## HPM Hooks

In Hercules, hooking is a simple operation, it is possible to hook an infinite number of times to the over 2k hookable functions (all the interfaced ones, accounting for over 99% of map server)  
```C
HPExport void plugin_init(void)
{
	addHookPre(pc, dropitem, my_pc_dropitem_preHook);  /* int my_pc_dropitem_preHook(struct map_session_data **sd, int *n, int *amount) */
	addHookPost(pc, dropitem, my_pc_dropitem_postHook); /* int my_pc_dropitem_postHook(int retVal, struct map_session_data *sd, int n, int amount) */ 
}
```

Hooks receive all function params as pointers, whereas the original may be

```C
int pc_dropitem(struct map_session_data *sd, int n, int amount)
```

the one for the prehook shall be

```C
(struct map_session_data **sd, int *n, int *amount)
```

which allows for hooks to modify any and all data as it pleases.  
postHooks receive one additional param, which accounts for the result of the original function,

```C
int <name>(int retVal, struct map_session_data *sd, int n, int amount)
```

In this case it'd allow for the postHook to react properly to what the original returned, in this case (for pc_dropitem) 0 (failure) or 1 (success)  
A full usage of this is demonstrated in the [HPM](HPM "wikilink")'s sample 

## HPM @commands

The [HPM](HPM "wikilink") makes it very simple to provide [@commands](@commands "wikilink") through plugins.  
You define a new atcommand exactly as it'd normally be done in
  
**Example:**
```C
ACMD(sample) { //@sample command - 5 params: const int fd, struct map_session_data* sd, const char* command, const char* message, struct AtCommandInfo *info
	clif->message(fd, "You used the @sample command!");
	ShowDebug("I'm being run! message -> '%s' by '%s'\n", message, sd->status.name);
	return true;
}
```
After that you just have to link your new command, to do that you use the `void plugin_init (void)` event.

```C
addAtcommand("sample", sample);
```

and voila, your plugin now adds the **@sample** command.  
A full usage of this is demonstrated in the [HPM](HPM "wikilink")'s sample 

As of [778facb21f](https://github.com/HerculesWS/Hercules/commit/778facb21f822cea549939c8dbee886e1cd342aa),
atcommands loaded via plugins will overwrite default/original commands with the same name.

## HPM Script Commands

The [HPM](HPM "wikilink") makes it very simple to provide through plugins.  
You define a new script command exactly as it'd normally be done in
  
**Example:**
```C
BUILDIN(sample) { //script command 'sample(num);' - 1 param: struct script_state* st
	int arg = script_getnum(st, 2);
	ShowInfo("I'm being run! arg -> '%d'\n", arg);
	return true;
}
```
After that you just have to link your new script command, to do that you use the `void plugin_init (void)` event.

```C
addScriptCommand("sample", "i", sample); //note the 2nd param is this commands' arg-types (in this case, a number)`
```
and voila, your plugin now adds the **sample** script command.  
A full usage of this is demonstrated in the [HPM](HPM "wikilink")'s sample 

## HPM Console Commands

The [HPM](HPM "wikilink") makes it very simple to provide through plugins.  
You define a new console command exactly as it'd normally be done in   
**Example:**
```C
CPCMD(sample) {//console command 'sample' - 1 param: char *line
	ShowInfo("I'm being run! arg -> '%s'\n", line?line:"NONE");
}
```

After that you just have to link your new script command, to do that you use the `void plugin_init (void)` event.
```C
addCPCommand("this:is:a:sample",CPCMD_A(sample)); // note the first param is the path to this command, in this case it translates to 'this is a sample' and everything afterwards is the commands' params
```

and voila, your plugin now adds the **sample** console command.  
A full usage of this is demonstrated in the [HPM](HPM "wikilink")'s sample 

## HPM Custom Packets

The HPM makes it possible for a plugin to add or override packets within all 3 servers  
**Example:**
```C
/* sample packet implementation */
/* cmd 0xf3 - it is a client-server existent id, for clif_parse_GlobalMessage */
/* in this sample we do nothing and simply redirect */
void sample_packet0f3(int fd) {
	struct map_session_data *sd = session[fd]->session_data;
	if (sd == NULL) return; /* socket didn't fully log-in? this packet shouldn't do anything then! */
	ShowInfo("sample_packet0f3: Hello World! received 0xf3 for '%s', redirecting!\n", sd->status.name);
	clif->pGlobalMessage(fd, sd);`  
}
void plugin_init(void) {
   addPacket(0xf3, -1, sample_packet0f3, hpClif_Parse);
}
```

and voila, your plugin just changed the map server's **0xf3** packet to pass by **sample\_packet0f3** prior to being sent to **clif\_parse\_GlobalMessage**  
A full usage of this is demonstrated in the [HPM](HPM "wikilink")'s sample 

## HPM Custom Data Structs

The HPM makes it possible for a plugin to create and append structs to existent data, this feature is currently supported on player units (map_session_data) and network pipes (socket_data)  
**Example:**
```C
/* can be of any size, using any data types */
struct sample_data_struct {
	struct point lastMSGPosition;
	unsigned int someNumber;
};

/* appends/reads sample_data_struct in a network session data entry (socket_data) */
void some_function_receiving_a_socket_fd(int fd) {
	struct sample_data_struct *data;
	if (!(data = HPMi->getFromSession(session[fd], HPMi->pid, 0))) {
		CREATE(data,struct sample_data_struct,1);
	
		data->lastMSGPosition.map = 1;
		data->lastMSGPosition.x = 150;
		data->lastMSGPosition.y = 150;
		data->someNumber = rand()%777;
	
		ShowInfo("Created Appended session[] data, %d %d %d %d\n", data->lastMSGPosition.map, data->lastMSGPosition.x, data->lastMSGPosition.y, data->someNumber);
		HPMi->addToSession(session[fd], data, HPMi->pid , 0, true);
	} else {
		ShowInfo("Existent Appended session[] data, %d %d %d %d\n", data->lastMSGPosition.map, data->lastMSGPosition.x, data->lastMSGPosition.y, data->someNumber);
		if (rand()%4 == 2) {
			ShowInfo("Removing Appended session[] data\n");
			HPMi->removeFromSession(session[fd], HPMi->pid, 0);
		}
	}
}
```

and voila, your plugin becomes capable of appending and handling your custom struct data  
A full usage of this is demonstrated in the [HPM](HPM "wikilink")'s sample 

## HPM Function Overloading

Thanks to [Hercules Renewal Phase One](Hercules_Renewal_Phase_One "wikilink"), you're capable of overloading all functions covered by the [Hercules Renewal Phase One](Hercules_Renewal_Phase_One "wikilink") interfaces, with your plugin.  
**Example:**
```C
int my_custom_check_target_function(struct block_list *src, struct block_list *target, int flag) {
	//<...> code
}
void plugin_init(void) {
	battle->check_target = &my_custom_check_target_function;
}
```
and voila, your plugin just overloaded the game server's **battle\_check\_target** function with your plugin's own, this is greatly handy to ensure your customs do not create conflicts when updating your [Hercules Repository](Hercules "wikilink")
