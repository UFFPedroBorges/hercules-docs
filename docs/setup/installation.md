This article is aimed at downloading Hercules and any dependancies required to run it. In this article, you are expected
to know basic file and program management of the OS you are attempting to run Hercules on. (Or use Google to search for
the answers)

## System Requirements

Hercules runs on variety of 32-bit and 64-bit (limited) operating systems, including Windows, Linux and Unix. Hardware
requirements are ones of typical server environment, whether virtual or dedicated.

## Program Requirements

To run Hercules, the following programs must be installed on the machine that will run Hercules:

### \*nix based

For \*nix, most of these programs will come as [Packages](wikipedia:Software_package_%28installation%29 "wikilink") with
your OS, for example, the FreeBSD Ports collection, or Debians apt-get or aptitude. Please see your OS's help/support
pages to find out how to utilize package installations. As a general rule, the following packages will be required to
compile Hercules:  
[wget](http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/), [subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/), [GCC](http://gcc.gnu.org/),
[make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/) (if running \*BSD, gmake is needed instead of make.)

#### libmysqlclient15-dev

libmysqlclient15-dev is the library for MySQL and is **required** to compile an SQL version of Hercules. This will most
likely need to be installed via packages.

### Windows based

Depending on how you want to compile, one of two methods can be used. We **highly recommend** the use of [Visual
C++](http://www.microsoft.com/Express/vc/). [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) can also be used. If cygwin is used, you
have some configuration to do, please see below:  

> Expand the development or devel branch in Cygwin and make sure GCC and Make are checked. These are the only 2 things
> you need, the others are up to you whether you want to download them or not. The downloading and installation of
> packages may take some time depending on your packages, their size, your network speed, and the remote server's
> network speed. This shouldn't take too long if it's just GCC and Make.

You will also need [subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/)

## Installing software

### Linux OS's

A simple make and make install is all that is needed for most of the packages. You can find
[instructions](:Category:Installation "wikilink") and readmes in each of the downloads for your distro telling you how
to install and compile each package. Once subversion is installed, you can download Hercules's latest source via
[GIT](GIT "wikilink").  
<code>

    $ git clone git://github.com/HerculesWS/Hercules.git hercules 

</code> for trunk

### Windows OS's

When using SVN in Windows, all your commands are in a right click menu integrated into the Windows Shell.  
![](svnwindows.jpg "svnwindows.jpg")  
Simply create a new folder, right click on it and select 'SVN Checkout...' and a dialog box will appear.  
![](checkout.jpg "checkout.jpg")  
Enter your URL (in the example above, simply add /trunk after the URL to checkout Trunk, or /branches/stable for stable)
and TSVN will download a fresh copy of Hercule's SVN to that folder.

## Compiling

Please see [Compiling](Compiling "wikilink") for more detailed instructions.

For your OS, you will need to compile binaries if you had downloaded Hercules via the SVN. you can then move on to
[:Category:Configuration](:Category:Configuration "wikilink") and then running Hercules.
