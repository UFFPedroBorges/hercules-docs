The **GID** stands for game id or game object id. It uniquely identifies each and every dynamic object
([NPC](npc), [monster](mob "wikilink"), player, item, skill unit) inside the game. For the players a GID is
their [account id](aid), for all other objects it is a server-generated id, that changes each time the object
is created.

You can view the id in-game by right-clicking on a object, when your account has enabled game master menu.
