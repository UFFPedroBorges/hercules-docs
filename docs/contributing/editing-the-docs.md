# Editing the Docs

The Hercules docs could always use help. It is an ever changing repository of useful information related to Hercules, such as configuration, connecting, setting up, Compiling and scripting. However, please follow the below points when trying to edit.

1. Do not create pages or guides for custom content. Base client specific content is OK, as this is the main point behind Hercules. However, leave patchers, custom patches or plugins, setup of custom items or mobs, or control panels out.
2. Be sure you write in proper and complete English.
3. For code examples, be sure you follow [Hercules' Coding Style](./coding-style.md).
